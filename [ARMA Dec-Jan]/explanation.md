Ok so hopefully this sheds some light on the entire situation with ARMA. 

**Backstory:**
Originally ARMA started from a Deathmatch server named GDM, I stopped working on GBRP and instead decided to work on creating a deathmatch server. It took around a week to make and after another week I was bored of the server entirely, so decided to sell it. Xonaa (or Rhys as many of you might know him now) decided to purchase Global Deathmatch for Â£150, because I felt bad and didn't have a project to work on at the time then I decided to help with the RP server for a bit due to the fact he wanted to turn a deathmatch into an RP server.

**Development:**
ARMA took around 7 months of development, althought people seem to think it was just a dump of CMG, unfortunately it's not that simple. Throughout the entire development process Rhys made a few banners, that was the majority of his help. He spent more time on his "clothing brand", Hybrid. Like many of his past ventures another attempt at making quick cash, hybridclothing.co.uk doesn't seem to be up anymore due to the fact he got a shopify trial and some cheap see through tshirts (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0668/9603/6160/products/image_2c4a48be-2689-429e-a8dc-f606ebcdb0d1.jpg?v=1670070996&width=823)

**Money:**
Originally the server was intended to be 50/50, after the months of development and the fact Rhys wasn't even on for the release day and from speaking to multiple people it was decided the first month would be a 70/30 split my way due to the fact all he seemed to do was a few tickets, even his claim that he was adding cars was just putting them on a sheet and getting Syrox to add them. Anyway, around the start of February Rayz and Ended offered to purchase the server for 30k. Rhys seemed very enticed by this because obviously it's a good amount of money but I didn't want to sell 7 months of work in an instant. After a few days the server was dead as fuck anyway and I believe Rayz stopped responding to Rhys about the sale. More recently, I got bored of the entire server and the fact it was dead, Rhys' only solution was to just keep doing mass unbans which resulted in more cheaters and the legit players leaving decreasing the pop even more. That's when I intended to leave and start CMG Frags for more of a fun server and less effort overall.

**For the claim that I apparently exit scammed:**

The clarify the server made in total around 3.3k, in January around 2.6k so the 70% cut would've been around 1800 and Rhys making 800 from doing tickets and supposedly adding cars, the entire situation recently became a thing because he thought the amount was unfair and cried over the difference of 800 to 1k. Not surprised considering what happened Regarding Oasis with Qwebse.

**Management:**
As I'm sure the majority of you are aware the management team has been shambles. Tylon the community manager has been noclipping looting bags, tping around redzones, taking money from the com pot to gamble

The most recent staff manager, dblock prior to being part of ARMA sat calling gas companies and food to Rhys' house causing him to get pressured and asking Callum (the old owner of HVC to clarify) for help.

The previous staff manager Ryan, cheated and was affiliated with multiple cheaters, from his claims this was after he was removed. Personally I don't agree with why he was removed but Rhys removed his staff manager for repairing his car with no one around. The management was a joke and there was 0 organisation, I would wake up with Rhys making the most retarded changes, one of which being the fact him and Tylon decided to announce a boot wipe not even a week into the server.



*All of the above was posted regarding the last ARMA with Rhys, which he apparently is now using my files again for Vesper. So rather than letting some sausage fingered spastic think he's some cool guy for having them. How about the entire community gets access because icl, I'd rather everyone use them to make their own fun little knockoffs.*
