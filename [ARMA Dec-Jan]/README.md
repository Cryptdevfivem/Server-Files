# ARMA

*These are not the current files of ARMA, these are from December '22 / January '23 prior to when I left and made CMG Frags and now the revival of ARMA. Use these files if you want, however there are many exploits, crashes I'm aware of triggering and multiple little issues. Also a lot missing from the current state of ARMA regarding factions and player interaction.*

*These files are susceptible to https://github.com/elfbars/fun-script so use at your own risk*
